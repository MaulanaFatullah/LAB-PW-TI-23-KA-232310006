        <h1>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages to Learn in 2022</h1>
        <p>
            There's no question that software porgramming is a hot carrer right nor. <span style="color: crimson;">U.S.
                Bureau of Labor Statistics</span> projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 2018 to 2028,
            which is more than four times the average for all occupations. What's more, the median annual pay for a
            software programmer is about $106,000, which nearly three times the median pay for all U.S. workers.
            <br><br>
            Not all programming jobs are the same, however. different roles, companies, and types of software require
            knowing and understanding different programming languages--and it's programming can be daunting experience,
            espescially for professionals with no prior programming experience. The <span
                style="color: deepskyblue;"><u>Master of Science in Computer Science Align program</u></span>at
            Northeastern University is specifically designed for students who want to transition into computer science
            from another field of study.
            <br>
        <blockquote>
            <i>“Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds and have them come out as
                software engineers,”</i> says Ian Gorton, PhD and director of the graduate computer science programs at
            Northeastern University--Seattle. <i>“We focus on math, programming, and variety of computer science and
                engineering concepts.”</i>

        Wheter you're new to programming or looking to brush up your skills, it helps to know which langages are in high
        demand. Here are 10 of the most popular programming languages of 2020 based on the number of job postings listed
        on job search site Indeed, the average annual salary for those jobs, and factors such as ease of use and
        potential for growth.
